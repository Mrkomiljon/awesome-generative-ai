## 💡 **Implementation Guide**

### 🚀 **Quick Start - Coqui TTS**
```python
from TTS.api import TTS

# Load a model with voice cloning capabilities
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/your_tts")

# Clone a voice with reference audio
tts.tts_to_file(
    text="Hello, this is a cloned voice!",
    speaker_wav="path/to/reference.wav",
    language="en",
    file_path="cloned_output.wav"
)
```

### 🚀 **Quick Start - RVC**
```python
# Using RVC for voice conversion
from rvc import RVC

# Load model and convert voice
rvc = RVC("path/to/model.pth")
converted_audio = rvc.convert("input_audio.wav")
```
